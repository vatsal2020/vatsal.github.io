## Welcome to Vatsal Shah's homepage

I am a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at The University of Texas at Austin, advised by Prof. Sujay Sanghavi. I am a part of WNCG (Wireless Networking and Communications Group) . My primary research interests lie at the intersection of Optimization, Machine Learning and Data Mining. My current research includes providing theoretical guarantees for time series data under various models, variance reduction for optimization and matrix factorization in recommender systems.

I obtained my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering and Master of Technology (Specialization: Communications and Signal Processing) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2014.

I have previously held research internship positions at Technicolor Research, Los Altos (2016)
